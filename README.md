<center>Next gen installer for qomo</center>
============================================
<br>
Hippo is a new installer for Qomo, featuring HTML5 and tornado.
By utilizing web tech, hippo will present user a whole new UX.

Install and testing
-----
```
git clone git@172.16.82.249:hippo.git 
cd hippo
./hippo.py
```
that will try to spawn server in the background and popup a 
chromium web browser as frontend, right now 
chromium is used as prototype usage, will be replaced later with own 
webkit frontend.

Roadmap
-------

### 1.0

1.0 is targetting installer only, and try to consolidate a framework
that can be easily applied to ther projects.

the big picture of the framework is as following:
each component in hippo (e.g partitioning, package installing...) 
provides a REST API, after service started, a websocket connection is 
used to push state information (e.g. for partitioning, that is progress
report).

data transformed between B/S is JSON over http or websocket.
server is written based on [tornado][0], facebook's web app framework.
the documentation is [here][1].

### 2.0

hippo is totally seprated into two parts. first is a webapp framework 
consolidated from 1.0. and second is a complete installer based on that
framework, and capable of extending.
