                p.
                    Red Flag Linux is a modular operating system made up of hundreds of
                    individual software components, each of which was written and
                    copyrighted individually. Each component has its own applicable End
                    User License Agreement. Throughout this document the components are
                    referred to, individually and collectively, as the "Linux
                    Programs." Most of the Linux Programs are licensed pursuant to a
                    Linux End User License Agreement that permits you to copy, modify,
                    and redistribute the software, in both source code and binary code
                    forms. You must review the license agreement that accompanies each
                        of the Linux Programs included in Red Flag product so that you
                        can understand and realize your rights and obligations under
                        those EULAs. Nothing in this agreement limits your rights
                        under, or grants you rights that supercede, the terms of any
                        applicable Linux EULA.
